# CYK-Parse
Robust CYK-Parse (on CNF strings) with easy CYK-Parse-Tree Retrieval.
Based on algorithm described by [Ernest Davis](https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ai/).

1. This program is written using python3.5
2. The files that are contained with the main py file (cyk_parser.py) are necessary and must be in the same directory as the main file
3. get_grammar.py is imported into cyk_parser.py and is used to read the grammar from file (grammar.txt), parse the grammar text and create the necessary objects
in which the grammar is stored.
4. To run, simply pass the file as an argument to the python interpreter `python3.5 cyk_parser.py`.
